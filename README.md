# StepperMotor

This is the discriptions for my project ON IGUS 5-DOF light weight robotic arm.

## Introduction

The project is based on the IGUS 5-DOF light weight robotic arm, which is a 5-axis robotic arm with a total weight of 2.5 kg. The arm is equipped with stepper motors, which are used to control the movement of the robotic arm. The project aims to develop a control system for the robotic arm, which can be used to perform various tasks such as picking and placing objects, and manipulating objects in a workspace.

## Hardware

The hardware components used in the project include:

* IGUS Robolink-Joints-W
* Stepper motors
* Stepper motor drivers
* Power supply
* Microcontroller
* Sensors 

## Control Algorithm

The control algorithm used in the project is based on the inverse kinematics (IK) algorithm. The IK algorithm is used to calculate the joint angles of the robotic arm based on the desired end-effector position and orientation. The algorithm takes into account the physical constraints of the robotic arm, such as the limits of the joint angles and the workspace of the end-effector. The algorithm is implemented in the microcontroller firmware, which is responsible for controlling the stepper motors and communicating with the sensors.

## Communication Protocol

The communication protocol used in the project is based on the serial communication protocol. The microcontroller firmware communicates with the sensors and the user interface (if available) using the serial communication protocol. The protocol is designed to be simple and efficient, and it allows for real-time communication between the microcontroller and the sensors and the user interface.
